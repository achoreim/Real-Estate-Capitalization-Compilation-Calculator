# Real-Estate-Capitalization-Compilation-Calculator

The Real Estate Capitalization Compilation Calculator or CCC for short, is an auto capitalization rate calculator, which uses machine learning to compile large groups of currently for sale properties, calculates their capitalization rates and other relevant data, lists them in aggregate order of capitalization, then shoots an email containing the properties in a neat and easy to read .CSV file to the desired destination.
