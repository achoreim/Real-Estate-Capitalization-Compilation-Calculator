# Real-Estate-Capitalization-Compilation-Calculator

The Real Estate Capitalization Compilation Calculator or CCC for short, is an auto capitalization rate calculator, which uses machine learning to compile large groups of currently for sale properties, calculates their capitalization rates and other relevant data, lists them in aggregate order of capitalization, then shoots an email containing the properties in a neat and easy to read .CSV file to the desired destination.



Next Steps:
- Integrate Zillow's Zestimate feature to create a systemcatic measuring tool which identifies a good deal vs a bad one.
- Integrate Zillow's rentZestimate to more accurately estimate viable rent prices.
- Integrate the use of databases to keep track of possible listing changes and recently sold/rented data points for further cap rate estimate accuracy.
- Combine all variable and data initialization into a singular for loop.
